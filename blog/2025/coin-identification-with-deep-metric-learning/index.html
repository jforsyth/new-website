His work will assist the Madison Art Collection in recovering lost ownership information from the <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/madisonart/_coin_collection.shtml" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sawhill Ancient Coin Collection</a>. He applied various deep metric learning methods to existing datasets of Roman Republican coins and validated his approach from sample images from the Sawhill collection.
