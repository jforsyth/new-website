Her research examined the effectiveness of haptic feedback when learning to read and write braille which is motivated by the challenges of sighted parents and teachers learning braille to support their visually impaired children and students. She was advised by myself, <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/coe/people/deportes-laura.shtml" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Laura Deportes</a> (Education), and <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/cise/people/faculty/castaneda-daniel.shtml" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Daniel Castaneda</a> (Engineering). A special thanks also to the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind for allowing us to tour their facilities.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/caulfield-seids-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/caulfield-seids-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/caulfield-seids-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/caulfield-seids.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Megan Caulfield Presentation at SIEDS 2024 </div> <h2 id="flash-talks-at-capwic-2024">Flash Talks at CAPWIC 2024</h2> <p>Two new members of the Wearable Computing Group, Julia Larson (Engineering) and Abby Ensogna (Computer Science), presented initial efforts on their work at the ACM Capitol Region Celebration of Women in Computing (CAPWIC).</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/julia-capwic2024-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/julia-capwic2024-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/julia-capwic2024-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/julia-capwic2024.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/abby-capwic2024-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/abby-capwic2024-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/abby-capwic2024-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/abby-capwic2024.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Julia Larson (left) and Abby Ensogna (right) at CAPWIC 2024 </div> <p>Julia’s talk entitled, “Design of a Wearable Coaching System for Shoulder Rehabilitation” discussed her preliminary results extending the research group’s haptic feedback system from two-dimensional motion into additional degrees of freedom to support shoulder and upper-arm rehabilitation. Abby described the pressing challenge in labeling human-activity data in her talk, “Labelling Data in the Field of Wearable Computing”. Her real-time labeling tool for human motions will help the lab more effectively collect data in field user studies.</p> </body></html>
