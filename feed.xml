A corollary to this fact is that any collection of sufficient size will contain some fakes. Many ancient fakes used a false core of copper with a silver or gold casing to pass as an authentic coin<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourr%C3%A9e">fourrées</a> (French for ‘stuffed’) are often hard to visually distinguish from authentic coins given the skill of the forgers or their illicit use of official dies. In ancient times this led to the use of <a href="https://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki//view.asp?key=Test%20Cut">test cuts</a> to physically open or cut coins to reveal their inner metal quality.</p> <div class="row mt-3" id="xray-figure"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/xray/xray-coins-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/xray/xray-coins-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/xray/xray-coins-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/xray/xray-coins.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Collection of modern and ancient coins. </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 d-flex align-items-center"> <div> <video class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline=""> <source src="/assets/video/xray/xray.mp4" type="video/mp4"/> </video> <div class="caption"> X-raying coins under increasing energy levels. </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 1: X-raying a collection of modern and ancient coins.

When applied to coins, fourrées and authentic coins will “respond” differently under X-ray as they have differing material composition. Objects made of lighter atomic mass, such as copper, will permit X-rays to pass more easily as compared to materials with heavier atomic mass, such as silver. Applying this principle to coin analysis, if two objects are roughly the same size and weight, an object that is mostly copper, such as a fourrée, will “disappear” more quickly under X-ray imaging than objects of solid silver.</p> <p>We can see this behavior dramatically on the right in <a href="#xray-figure">Figure 1</a>. The modern US coins on the left (mostly made of copper, tin, or light amounts of silver), and the known fourrées on the right, rapidly “disappear” as the energy level of X-rays increases. However, the “good” denarii in the middle last longer and remain until the X-rays reach their maximum energy levels.</p> <p>The results from this experiment are clear. The known fakes, <a href="https://jmu.emuseum.com/objects/1345/didrachm-fourree-of-cales-campania?ctx=662334f6726c8baf0e59938e980d74aa9d680e67&amp;idx=0">Didrachm of Cales</a> (item D) and <a href="https://jmu.emuseum.com/objects/8792/denarius-fourree-of-augustus-p-petronius-turpilianus-as?ctx=35390601737cbe164b79324a8f3a347d7ebd0af5&amp;idx=2">Denarius of Augustus</a> (item F), were re-confirmed to be fake.

The same machine used to identify broken bones can be used for broken coins too. The central idea is that when an X-ray strikes an atom, there is a chance the X-ray is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray#Photoelectric_absorption">absorbed based upon the atomic number of the object and the energy of the X-ray</a>. This absorbed X-ray will not appear on the detector and will show up as “white” in the image. This is why a person’s bones are shown in an X-ray as they are more “dense” than the surrounding tissue. In general, the probability of absorption \(\approx{} \frac{Z^3}{E^3}\), where \(Z\) is the atomic number of an element and \(E\) is the energy of the X-ray.</p> <p>Applying this principle to our ancient coins, if two coins are of similar mass and are exposed to equal X-ray energies, then the one composed of “lighter” atomic material will pass more X-rays and thus appear more transparent in the X-ray image when compared to the “heavier” one. Thus, a good denarius of solid silver (Ag with atomic number 47) should be less transparent than a fourrée filled with copper (Cu with atomic number 29). As energy increases, however, both materials will eventually be unable to stop the X-rays. The figure <a href="#x-ray-energy-comparison">below</a> shows a cross section of the X-ray behavior for each object.</p> <div class="row mt-3" id="xray-energy-comparison"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/xray/xray-low-energy-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/xray/xray-low-energy-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/xray/xray-low-energy-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/xray/xray-low-energy.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/xray/xray-medium-energy-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/xray/xray-medium-energy-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/xray/xray-medium-energy-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/xray/xray-medium-energy.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 3: X-ray penetration and absorption for various energies in ancient coins and fourrées </div> <p>This behavior can be seen most clearly with coins of vastly differing compositions. <a href="#modern-xrays">Figure 4</a> below shows how various modern US coins respond under increasing X-ray intensity. The three coins, from the top, going clockwise, are a <a href="https://en.numista.com/5830">1907 Barber Dime</a> (2.5g at 90% Silver), <a href="https://en.numista.com/1109">Buffalo Nickel</a>, (5g at 75% Copper and 25% Nickel), and a <a href="https://en.numista.com/45">1943 Jefferson Nickel</a> (5g at 56% Copper, 35% Silver, 9% Manganese). These are shown as “A” in <a href="#xray-figure">Figure 1</a>.</p> <p>Given their different compositions, we should expect the “lighter” coins (both in mass and atomic composition) to permit X-rays to pass more easily. As seen in the images, even though the Barber Dime is made of silver (a heavier material), its small mass of only 2.5g easily allows X-rays to pass through at medium energies, whereas the Buffalo Nickel at 5g still remains. Finally, at the highest energy, only the Jefferson Nickel remains.</p> <div class="row" id="modern-xrays"> <div class="col-12"> <div class="row mt-2"> <div class="col-sm mt-1 mt-md-0" style="flex: 0 0 27%;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/xray/moderns-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/xray/moderns-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/xray/moderns-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/xray/moderns.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption">Collection of modern US coins</div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-1 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/xray/modern-xray-low-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/xray/modern-xray-low-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/xray/modern-xray-low-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/xray/modern-xray-low.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption">Response under low X-ray</div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-1 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/xray/modern-xray-medium-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/xray/modern-xray-medium-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/xray/modern-xray-medium-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/xray/modern-xray-medium.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption">Response under medium X-ray</div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-1 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/xray/modern-xray-high-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/xray/modern-xray-high-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/xray/modern-xray-high-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/xray/modern-xray-high.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption">Response under high X-ray</div> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 4: Modern US coins under various X-ray levels </div> </div> </div> <h3 id="experimental-setup-and-results">Experimental Setup and Results</h3> <p>Applying these methods to our ancient coins, we selected several “good” denarii<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> as control objects from the Curator of Coins <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jasonsancientcoins/">personal collection</a> (Items B and C) and several suspected fourrées from the collection (Items D, E, and F).
