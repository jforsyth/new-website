  title={Navigating with Haptic Gloves: Investigating Strategies for Horizontal and Vertical Movement Guidance},
  author={Tajdari, Mahdis and Forsyth, Jason and Lim, Sol},
  journal={International Journal of Human-Computer Studies},
  volume={203},

  abstract={Navigating peripersonal space requires reaching targets in both horizontal (e.g., desk) and vertical (e.g., shelves) layouts with high precision. We developed a haptic glove to aid peripersonal target navigation and investigated the effectiveness of different feedback delivery methods. Twenty-two participants completed target navigation tasks under various conditions, including scene layout (horizontal or vertical), guidance approach (two-tactor or worst-axis first), guidance metaphor (push or pull), and intensity mode (linear or zone) for conveying distance cues. Task completion time, hand trajectory distance, and percentage of hand trajectory in critical area were measured as the performance outcome, along with subjective feedback. Participants achieved significantly faster task completion times and covered less hand trajectory distance in the horizontal layout, worst-axis first approach, and pull metaphor conditions. Additionally, male participants demonstrated superior performance and reported lower levels of frustration compared to their female counterparts throughout the study. Intensity mode had no significant effect on the results. In summary, vibrating one tactor at a time (worst-axis first) and using the pull metaphor were the most effective way of delivering vibrotactile feedback for peripersonal target navigation in both horizontal and vertical settings. Findings from this work can guide future developments of haptic gloves for people with vision impairments, environments with vision limitations, and for accessibility and rehabilitation applications.},
