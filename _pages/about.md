I am an Associate Professor of Engineering at James Madison University with research interests spanning wearable computing, engineering education, and digital humanities. 

I serve as Co-Director of the [Wearable Computing Group](https://jmu-wearable-computing.github.io/), where my students and I develop wearable systems that provide real-time haptic feedback and assessment during physical activities. Our recent work focuses on using vibrotactile feedback to guide movement correction during exercise and physical therapy, with applications ranging from shoulder rehabilitation to general athletic training. 

I also serve as Co-Director of the [COIN Research Group](https://www.recoveringsawhill.com/) and Curator of Coins for the Madison Art Collection, where we apply computer vision and machine learning methods to problems in coin classification and provenance recovery. Also, we conduct archival and digitization work to protect numismatic collections.
