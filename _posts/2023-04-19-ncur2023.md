Megan Caulfield (JMU Engineering '24) and Justin Blevins (JMU Engineering '23) presented their research on wearable computing systems and haptic feedback. Their work explores how to provide haptic "instructions" to guide a person's motion.

This work is an initial step on our larger progress to create general systems to provide feedback during physical therapy. Their poster is available [here](/assets/pdf/ncur-poster-2023.pdf).

Justin will be graduating this semester and beginning work with Northrup Grumman in Charlottesville. Megan is a rising senior and will continue her research as honors thesis by exploring haptic feedback to improve braille reading and writing.
