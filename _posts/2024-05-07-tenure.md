Based upon action by the James Madison University Board of Visitors on April 19th I have been granted tenure effective August 25th, 2024. I am excited to continue my work as an Associate Professor of Engineering and [Curator of Coins](https://www.jmu.edu/madisonart/people/index.shtml) at JMU for a long time.

This could not be accomplished without the tremendous support of many people including: the other members of the "Engineering Triplets" Shraddha Joshi and Daniel Castaneda who started with me in 2018, my CS "brothers-in-law" of Michael Stewart and Kevin Molloy, my doctoral advisor Tom Martin, the multitude of undergraduate researchers who have passed through the Wearable Computing Group, and the constant love and support of my wife, Katie Forsyth.
